# Hotel-Management-Phase-4
This project is an object-oriented programming(OOP) in mode-view-controller(MVC) design Java program that implements a hotel management system. The program starts in the login menu with commands for registering, logging in, deleting an account, or changing a password. In each menu there are several commands and you get different messages after entering different commands. There are two types of users: hotel owners and guests.

Once logged in, guests are directed to the guest menu while hotel owners are directed to the hotel owner menu. Both menus offer several commands for managing reservations, adding and buying hotel rooms and hotel foods, and more.

note that this program does not currently have a graphical user interface (GUI).
